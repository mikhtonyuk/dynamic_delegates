==== dynamic delegates 0.1.0.5 (24 April 2010) ====
- operator() uses perfect forwarding pattern
- no copying overhead for methods
- one copying per argument left for static functions (seems unavoidable)


==== dynamic delegates 0.1.0.0 (24 April 2010) ====

- restructured and refactored initial version
- generating 'make_delegate' const and non-const version with macro
- removed obsolete msvc6 hacks, targeting C++0x now
- replaced error generations with static_assert
- extracted delegate traits class
- extracted base delegate_n class removing most of the repeating functions
- added 'make_delegate's for static functions (returns func-style delegate now)
- added dynamic delegates !!! (old zero-overhead delegates left too, to be used in cases when we don't need invoking)
- generating function-style 'delegate' and 'delegate_dynamic' with macro
- generating 'make_delegate_dynamic' and 'make_delegate' with macro
